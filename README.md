  i. Detect seasonality type (multiplicative or additive) for each cluster of APMC and commodities
  ii. De-seasonalise prices for each commodity and APMC according to the detected seasonality type
3. Compare prices in APMC/Mandi with MSP(Minimum Support Price)- raw and deseasonalised
4. Flag set of APMC/mandis and commodities with highest price fluctuation across different commodities in each relevant season, and year.
